     <h1 style="font-family:Algerian;"><em>Project idea:</em></h1>
	 <main>
		 
		<h2 class="intro">Overview:</h2>
        <p>As a project I would like to develop light, fun application which will connect colour to a melody or tone. I would like to develop it as the computer application. This application would be in form of question and answer.</p>
        <p>Question would be asked to user and then the answer should be picking up a colour evoked by that question.
Once when 4 questions answered a 4 chord progression should be calculated and played either as a arpeggio or a chord melody formation.
Choose of colour would be driven by questions from motivation psychology and also connected to a harmonized chords from one scale so it makes musical sense once when any colour chosen.</p>

         <h2 class="intro">Motivation:</h2>

        <p>This application should be executed as a light fun application for relaxing. A lot of people would download this and have fun. Musicians would be able to use it to generate chord progressions if they lack ideas but in a fun way. Another interesting thing is this doesn’t necessarily have to be executed as a psychological motivation questionary. It could be a version for zodiac lovers to for example do their perfect match of zodiac signs in accordance to behaviour or colour or felling and create music that way. For marketing purposes colours could be changed by matching zodiac signs, or signs with colours and hearing the melody.</p>
		

         <h2 class="intro">Description:</h2>

        <p>As described above application meant to be started with question and then answers should be colours picked bby user. Once answers are assembled for three or four questions melody should be calculated out of colours chosen. Key should be determined by the first and/or second colour.</p>
        <p>Form of questions could vary from various topics. The most interesting topic in my opinion are the questions from motivational psychology. The questions should be assembled in maybe 5 different types (different sets randomly chosen at the app start) at the beginning to keep app easy and simple.</p>

        <p>When first colour taken it should chose the key and then the rest of the colours/chords should be formed as part of that key. It would be better if possible through development, to determine the key after two answers or even three, to give it more variety of melodies.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2> 
    <p><em>Chose the colour your day started with?</em>  Colour Blue key chosen C Major.</p>
    <p><em>Chose the colour your day went so far? </em>   Brown. If that note doesn’t belong to a key of C if its G# for example then new combination should be chosen wheere this color belongs to key of C (Mathematically do all the combinations and make it working-How each colour acts in a constellation of other colour being chosen as a key.)</p>
    <p><em>Chose the colour you hope how it will end? </em> Yellow, same process as above,with narowing number of possible chord combos if there is more questions.  </p>
    <p>Three chords melody should be played and instruments should be available. 
    Violin, piano, cello, etc </p>
<h2><em>Compose Colours!!</em></h2>
<p>This button should pop up for execution of chord progression </p>
 
<p>The melody could be played as an arpeggio or just chord pattern and it should be possible to change after answers are given and melody established. Also play on different instruments like guitar violin piano or cello should be available</p>
<p>Environment should be pleasing with calm background photos of nature filled with motivational famous quotes.</p>
<p>This interactive programme can be fun to describe the felling by colour and then hear it as a sound or melody. Another level of application could be a shades of certain colour nominated as a chords within harmonised scale. Different shades of same colour or even different colours and their shades would form melody of that combination. This would be probably bigger project since shades of one colour chosen but in this way variety of application versions could be widen to almost any topic to be connected into this idea.</p>
<p>Some serious application of this software would be using it for therapeutic purposes for people with disabilities or people negatively affected by  life. During my previous work with kids affected by war I realised that connection to music and evoking feelings through colour and music can be extremely positive and can give great results.</p>
<p>There is a lot of chord progression generator websites or applications but none of them which can be used in a fun simple way for relaxation as well as for other more serious purposes.</p>
  


         <h2 class="intro">Tools and Technologies:</h2>
       <p>Software development tools are crucial in this process and learning how to use them to create stable applications. Those tools are the gateway to materialize all ideas into a reality.
Not just development is achieved through these but a workflow is maintained and the whole process is way more productive and optimized.
       This brings the second point of skills required to use these tools and be a person who can create programs.</p>
      <p>That is one of the reasons I attend this course. I want to be able to write programs in programing language designated for it, know how to use software development tools and to familiarize with platforms on which they are dwelling.</p>
         <h2 class="intro">Skills:</h2>
      <p>Knowing one of the programing languages is essential. Understanding the algorithms for sorting out tricky programing hurdles is another important part of development. Mastering developing platforms (Operating Systems) because we need to be familiar with system for which we are writing programmes. Also it important to be able to build and test the code through various platforms. To get through all process and gain the skills is not an easy job. One of the reason for that to be able to assemble ideas to reality is why I’m attending course and why I will keep going to gain more knowledge about this particular topic.</p>
        <h2 class="intro">Outcome:</h2>
<p>If the project is succesful It will have great impact on me because I’ll know that I’m one step closer to rule all needed knowledge to achieve practical completion of any idea I  have.
On the practical side of view I think there will be an very interesting app amongst the sea of apps. It will be a flexible app which could be used for fun but also for making some new ideas as a musician by randomly formed chord progressions.</p> 
With proper developement and when accompanied with good workshop from mediator, it can be used to help people overcome certain issues, where app could be used as a part of determining the way of approaching person with certain need.</p>
