     <h1 style="font-family:Algerian; "><em>Interest in IT:</em></h1>
	 <main>
		 
		    <p>My interest in IT started since I was little kid. I was so passionate with playing games on my commodore 64 and later Amiga 500.Later in my high school I had IT as part of my education for audio and video technician. Always I enjoyed using computers regardless was it for fun of for school or work.</p>
            <p>My current interests are to make use of IT for my music production and any ideas I may have connected to music. My experience with IT did not involve actual programing as I did more computer maintenance and customized hardware assembly for my personal purposes. My current job involves using specialized applications and platforms on everyday basis.</p>
            <p>My biggest inspiration is the fact that the use of IT in music production has evolved to a level which not long ago could have been considered as sci-fi. 
I want to join to that stream. 
I want to contribute to this evolution.</p>
            <p>Being able to write computer code opens up a lot of horizons for a musician especially experienced. Once I gain the skill of coding I think that as a developer I can contribute more because of my experience in music. Any person can learn the code but people with experience in certain field can contribute more to applications, resolve any problems or anything really needed to certain development which is connected to that particular field. In most cases developers just get the work as what needs to be done. In the case when developer has the experience in the field for which he is doing any sort of development, application or software, that opens a lot more possibility to advance the whole process. My experience in IT is connected to my daily use of applications at my work and daily use of music applications in my studio because these days music production is unimaginable without use of computers.
Applications and software design in evolution of producing music and music related content is applicable in any field of music, from music notation through performance to broadcasting and entertainment at the end.
Since that is my point of interest I want to learn the skills which will enable me to develop my ideas.</p>
            <p>I personally would like to run through the whole path of software and web development .My first goal is to learn basic languages and tools and then going to some more complex topics of inner workings off applications and tools.Another topic I want to focus on is inner working of Operating systems (Windows, Linux) because they are the platforms on which these applications live. Mix of all that: software design, programming, and marketing and musical skills can contribute greatly in expressing the ideas in music industry.</p>
            <p>The jobs in accordance to above classification could span from interactive media specialists to programmers. I want to be able to change my career into something like that. Flexibility in work is possible in this result based industries. And also I think that I’m collaborative and have a good communication skill which is extremely important in this type of jobs working in a team.
First thing I can do about it is to make myself able to create and express my ideas. This university is a perfect spot to gain such knowledge. I done expression of interest through Open Universities that I want to study this field and they recommended me RMIT.I done a research and accepted an invite and here I’m.</p>
            <p>I want to cross my experience in a field of music with knowledge I will gain through the RMIT courses to materialize my ideas in music production.</p>
