               <p>My name is Dario Moconja.</p>
			   <p>I came to Australia 17 years ago in 2005.</p>
			   <p>I came from former Yugoslav republic and now country Bosnia and Herzegovina. My nationality is Serbian and culture could be closely described as Orthodox, Slavic, Eastern European culture.</p> 
               <p>Before coming to Australia I completed primary school, high school: Electro technician for audio and video systems and finally Bachelor of Law (I never graduated as I came to Australia).
During my student times I spent a lot of time working with kids affected by the war. I done it through various sessions and workshops and that was one of my occupations while I was living there.</p>
               <p>My big passion is music, as a bass player for last 30 years I recorded some albums and done live tours with artists overseas and here in Australia.(<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5PshotdRI4I5wLOwJ4zYJZ">Spotify – Balkan Ethno Orchestra</a>,
			   <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Z9lDNIuVxbxn8vpUlEFBB"> Spotify – Blues Exile</a>,
			   <a href=" https://open.spotify.com/artist/59A9jZEzgPkmtUR1D5JnugSpotify"> Spotify – Six Tonnes of Dirt</a>)
			   <p>I also have a huge interest in music production. I own a small home studio where I’m doing recordings for artists here in Australia and overseas.
Currently my main occupation is Site Manager on construction site and that’s what I have been doing for living in last 17 years.</p>
