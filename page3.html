    <main>
	<p>This position would be perfect for me for various reasons. Main one would be because I have long experience using audio applications as a recording musician and a home studio based producer.
With that in mind and development of my knowledge through RMIT I hope I would be great part of any team developing such applications for any platform.</p>
    <p>Skills and qualifications needed for this job are:  software development in C++ and software development in general, development on various platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS), experience in work with audio software and knowledge of digital audio processing.</p>
    <p>All of the above are my exact interest and reason why I want to qualify myself for such tasks through RMIT University.
Through my courses Iâ€™m hoping that I will gain knowledge in software development and learn C++ and also that I will learn how to apply it on various platforms. All together I hope that I will be able to contribute in team environment and as an individual in developing, testing and releasing of various software.</p>
     <p>Once when that is achieved and crossed with my experience in audio software and recording and playing instruments, I think I would make a great part of team which is designated to developing certain applications for that use.</p>
     <p>My path to gain the knowledge will follow the path of University courses to first get familiar with platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS),then familiarizing myself with at least one solid programming language. Finally I would like to learn industry standard software development tools to be able to work in team environment.</p>
